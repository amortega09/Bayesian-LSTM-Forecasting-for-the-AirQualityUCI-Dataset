# Bayesian-LSTM-Forecasting-for-the-AirQualityUCI-Dataset
#This repository contains code for a Bayesian LSTM model applied to air quality time series forecasting. 



It includes data preprocessing steps such as Hampel filtering for outlier detection, feature engineering with cyclic components, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection. The core of the solution is a Bayesian LSTM implemented in PyTorch and Pyro, which quantifies prediction uncertainty through variational inference.


Results are shown in the png file.
